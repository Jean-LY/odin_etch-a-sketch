Transform the behavior of a square when interacting with the mouse by introducing a series of modifications.

Rather than a simple color change from black to white, each interaction should randomize the square’s RGB value entirely.
Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square. The objective is to achieve a completely black square only after ten interactions.
You can choose to do either one or both of these challenges, it’s up to you.
